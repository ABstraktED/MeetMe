		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Main purpose of this service is to simplify contacting and meeting people, 
		those who are especially new in the town and also those who are your old friends. 
		Idea is simple, you run the application, set up an event, invite people, 
		look up if everything is allright and everybody is on his way to the place and then 
		meet without surprises or delays. For example, in our city and university there is 
		a lot of foreign students. This app would help them to integrate with other students.
		App may be target to the party cowboys who are new in the town, people who try to
		integrate with new people, bored tourist looking for quick open events, lost
		friends who are on the wrong street close to the meeting group, impatient
		persons who want to track latecomers
