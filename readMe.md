=== MeetMe[working title] Project Description          		     ===
========================================================================

	Main purpose of this service is to simplify contacting and meeting your friends, those one you see every day and those you haven't seen for ages. Each day you travel through the city, where each day your friends do the same. How often you pass each other without knowing that? what if this is your "long-time-not-seen" friend from childhood? How good would be to "catch up" with him and drink a cup of tea or a glass of beer? Pretty good! With our app user will have possibility(one of many) to track nearest area (for example with different radius) looking for friends from his contact book. Then, easily set up a meeting and contact with them. This main functionality would work independently on synchronized social service or application platform. Just one click and other will have notifications whatever they are using(Facebook, Google+). Going further, this app may be target to the party cowboys who are new in the town, people who try to integrate with new people, bored tourist looking for quick open events, lost friends who are on the wrong street close to the meeting group, impatient persons who want to track latecomers.
